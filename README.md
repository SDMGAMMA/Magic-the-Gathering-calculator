# Magic-the-Gathering-calculator
An abandoned card pack calculator that calculates the chances of opening packs. The project is old and not optimised for public usage.  

This calculator is able to calculate what the most average result would be when opening booster packs.  
It can output how many unique cards you will open in a set and it could also output how many duplicate unique cards you will open.  
It will also do these with each rarity.  

Example with one booster pack / 3 uncommons:  
"Of the rarity uncommon, you have opened 1 duplicates a total of 1.79 times out of 80 cards"  
"Of the rarity uncommon, you have opened 2 duplicates a total of 0.01 times out of 80 cards"  
...  
"Wild cards: 0.2"  

It also works when the array the program works with already has cards added to it.

The calculator is very accurate, but not user friendly in the slightest.  

For development purposes in the future, look at the function AddCard.
